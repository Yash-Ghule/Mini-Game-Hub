# 🎮 Mini-Game Hub

A collection of fun, browser-based mini-games built with React.

## 📝 About the Hub
Mini-Game Hub is an expanding library of interactive games you can play directly in your browser. Each game is built as a React component, making the hub modular and easy to extend.

## 1️⃣ Tic-Tac-Toe
**Tech Stack:** React, CSS Modules  
**How to Play:** Two players take turns placing X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
**Draw Condition:** If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.  

**Challenges Faced:** Implementing win detection logic efficiently and integrating the game into the hub's routing system.

## 2️⃣ Rock Paper Scissors
**Tech Stack:** React, CSS  
**How to Play:**  
1. Click one of the buttons — Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  
2. The bot will instantly make its choice.  
3. The winner is decided based on classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

**Challenges Faced:** Positioning UI elements for a balanced layout and implementing the animated result overlay similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.

## 3️⃣ Snake Game  
**Tech Stack:** React, CSS, JavaScript (Canvas API)  
**How to Play:**  
1. Use the arrow keys (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️) to move the snake around the board.  
2. Eat the food squares to grow longer and score points.  
3. Avoid running into the walls or your own tail — that ends the game.  

**Challenges Faced:**  
- Implementing smooth grid-based movement while keeping the snake responsive.  
- Handling collision detection for both walls and self-intersections.  
- Balancing game speed for both beginners and experienced players.
